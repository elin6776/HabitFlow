# HabitFlow

HabitFlow is a React Native mobile application an app that will promote healthy habits and help support users in maintaining them. The main goal is to make habit building easier and more enjoyable. The app will be primarily targeting individuals who struggle with habit building or maintaining them. Our strategy to do this will be by offering users new challenges to try and providing opportunities to discuss these challenges with others. Traditional habit-tracking methods often feel repetitive and uninspiring, making it difficult to stay consistent. By constantly taking on a new challenge users will find it more engaging and enjoyable.

In addition to this we also implemented an experience point system that will reward the users for having a consistent habit. This system will provide users with tangible incentives, reinforcing their commitment to consistent habit building.What makes our app unique is that it encourages users to constantly try new challenges. Users will feel more connected to others on a similar journey, making it easier to stay committed and share experiences, tips, and encouragement, ultimately enhancing their chances of building and maintaining healthy habits.
